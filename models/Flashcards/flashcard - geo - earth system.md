fundamental causes of earth surface processes (2)
?
**mechanics** are driven by 1. kinetic energy (heat) 2. potential energy (gravitational potential)

specific causes of earth surface processes
?
besides topography, **radiogenic heat**, **primordial heat**, heat from **uneven solar heating** and other heat sources e.g. tidal friction from the Moon's pull on Earth

what is radiogenic heat?
?
heat from **decay of radioactive isotopes** in **crust and mantle**

what is primordial heat?
?
heat left over from planetary formation and accretion

what is the result of radiogenic and primordial heat on the earth?
?
mantle convection, which then drives plate tectonics

what is the result of uneven solar heating?
?
atmospheric circulation (of water); water cycle then contributes to rock cycle

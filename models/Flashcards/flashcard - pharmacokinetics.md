what is pharmacokinetics about
?
how a drug is absorbed, distributed through, metabolized and eliminated from body

phases of pharmacokinetics
?
1. absorption (from site of administration to bloodstream)
2. distribution (once in bloodstream, how it moves in out through tissue)
3. metabolism (how drug is chemically altered - activated, inactivated)
4. elimination (how drug moves out the body)

phases of pharmacokinetics, with parameters that define them
?
1. absorption - bioavailability
2. distribution - volume of distribution
3. metabolism - half-life
4. elimination - clearance rate

excretion vs elimination
?
excretion - getting rid of drug while it's still active; elimination - chemically turning drug inactive

bioavailability definition
?
fraction of drug absorbed into systemic circulation from site of administration

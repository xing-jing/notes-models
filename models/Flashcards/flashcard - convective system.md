#flashcards/convective_system

components of convective system
?
upper and lower boundaries with temperature difference. fluid between upper and lower boundaries. fluid parcel (to analyse)

interaction within convective system
?
1. buoyancy: upwards displacement of fluid parcel
2. viscosity, thermal conductivity: dampening of upwards displacement force

fundamental cause of interaction within convective system
?
gravitational instability (due to density difference, typically from temperature difference (thermal expansion coefficient))

gravitational instability within convective system may lead to
?
convective instability, if insufficiently damped (e.g. by viscosity, thermal conduction)

surface expression of mantle convection is
?
plate tectonics

earth surface, viewed in terms of convective system is
?
top cold thermal boundary layer

earth's top cold thermal boundary layer is subdivided into
?
tectonic plates

components of earth's top cold thermal boundary layer, in geology terms, and causes: (imagine labeling all significant features)
?
tectonic plates with plate boundaries - convergent, divergent, transform due to mantle convection. faults and folds due to rheology of plates + mantle convection.

forces that plates are subject to
?
tensional, compressive, shear stresses

forces that plates are subject to result in
?
crustal deformations - faults and folds

definition of fault - informal and formal
?
informal: break in rock formation + slip along it
formal: planes along which shear motion of adjacent walls takes place when frictional strength of material is exceeded (stress overcomes friction)

definition of folds
?
layers of rock deformed by plastic deformation

earthquakes are characterized by
?
location, magnitude (amount of energy released), intensity (destructive effects of ground shaking)

convection definition
?
buoyancy driven fluid flow

rayleigh number describes
?
behavior of fluids when mass density of fluid is non-uniform

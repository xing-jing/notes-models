structure view - rock types
?
igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic

process/interaction view - processes in rock cycle
?
- to create sedimentary - compaction, cementation, lithification
- to create metamorphic - melting
- to create igneous - recrystallization
- indirectly, to create sedimentary - uplift and exposure, weathering, transport, deposition

compaction definition
?
continued compression of buried sediments reduces **pore-spaces** and removes excess water

cementation definition
?
chemical change whereby individual grains are cemented together as minerals are **precipitated** out of **saturated solution** that is percolating as a matrix between individual sediments
- note - like compaction, there is removal of water (saturation of solution precipitates minerals)

lithification
?
either compaction, cementation or both

weathering definition
?
process that disintegrates and **loosens** rock

types of weathering and factors affecting **rate**
?
- chemical: depends on particle size (surface area exposed to chemical attack), permeability (rate at which water seeps into rock body - dictates internal surface area exposed to weathering)
- mechanical: freeze-thaw cycles, wet-dry cycles, heating and cooling cycles

types of transport
- sediment transport (i.e. mechanical)
- solutional transport (i.e. chemical)

regolith definition
?
weathered rock (any degree of weathering)

saprolite definition
?
weathered rock that is sufficiently broken down that it can be readily augured through or dug through, yet retains the original rock structure

deposition definition
?
the laying down of sediment by chemical, physical or biological means; output: **sedimentary bodies**

pharmacodynamics is about
?
how drug acts on a body

what is the dose response relationship
?
"the dose makes the poison"

cite a real life implementation of dose response relationship
?
public health standards that specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in **food**, **public drinking water** and the **environment**

definition of "side effect"
?
an effect, whether **therapeutic** or **adverse**, that is **secondary** to the **primary one** intended

definition of adverse effect
?
side effect that is **adverse**

example of drug with beneficial side effect
?
Sildenafil, synthesized by Pfizer, initially studied for use in hypertension and angina pectoris, with little effect on angina but could induce marked penile erection. sold under the brand name **Viagra**

definition of adverse **event**. important characteristic about it.
?
any unfavourable and unintended symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medical treatment of procedure that may or may not be considered related to medical treatment or procedure. importantly, it's **quantifiable** - has different **severities**, called **grade**, from 1 (mild) to 5 (death)

definition of **therapeutic window**
?
**dosage range** between a **minimum effective therapeutic concentration** and the **minimum toxic concentration**

definition of therapeutic index
?
quantification of **relative safety** of drug, which is what the **therapeutic window** also indicates. defined as TD50/ED50 (dose (concentration) of drug that causes toxic response in 50% of population/dose of drug that is therapeutically effective in 50% of population)

high therapeutic index is equivalent to what in therapeutic window
?
large therapeutic window, drug is fairly safe

a safer drug is quantifiably:
?
higher therapeutic index, large lethal dose, small effective dose

more dangerous drug is quantifiably:
?
lower therapeutic index, may require regular monitoring of drug levels

efficacy definition
?
maximum effect a drug can produce regardless of dose

potency definition. determined by?
?
amount of drug needed to produce a given effect. determined by affinity of drug for receptor and the number of receptors available

overall function of digestive system
?
take in food, break food down into micronutrients, absorb nutrients into bloodstream to be dispersed into tissues to be used as energy or building blocks (materials), defecate anything remaining

specific functions of digestive system (6)
?
intake of food, secretion of enzymes/mucus to combat friction, mixing and propulsion, digestion (mechanical and chemical), absorption (of different elements at different sites), excretion of indigestible products

how structure leads to function in esophagus
?
muscle-wise: skeletal muscle for first third (voluntary), skeletal and smooth for second third, smooth muscle only (involuntary) for bottom third. cell-wise: stratified squamous for protection

how structure leads to function in stomach
?
stomach function: first site of mechanical and chemical digestion for protein. hence structure - muscle-wise: three layers of muscle instead of two for churning and mechanical digestion. cell-wise: columnar, for secretion and absorption

first site of protein digestion is
?
stomach

first site of fat digestion is
?
small intestine

stomach is site of digestion of?
?
protein

small intestine is site of digestion of?
?
fat

on different "states" of digestive system. infants lack what in their digestive system?
?
suck-swallow coordination, continence of gastroesophageal sphincter tone, intestinal peristalsis...

on different "states" of digestive system. elderly have what in digestive system
?
mouth changes (age-related shrinkage of maxillary (upper jaw) and mandibular (lower jaw) bones resulting in slow erosion of tooth sockets), swallowing changes (muscular contractions that initiate swallowing slow down, increasing pharyngeal transit time and increasing risk of choking)

on different "states" of digestive system. differences between what browsers and grazers eat:
?
browses: more heterogeneous assembly of plant parts of various nutritional qualities, branching geometry is diffuse and irregular, tends to be discrete in dispersion (next nearest neighbor is less likely to be a browse). grass: relatively homogenous food source (leaves, stem, sheath, fruit differ on fine-scale that cannot be differentiated by large mammalian herbivores). continuous 3d layer of vegetation with constant density (next nearest plant is likely a grass)

on different "states" of digestive system. differences between what browsers and grazers have in digestive system
?
molar structure (higher crowns allow for longer wear), mouth structure (wider muzzle to maximize bite size while reducing ability of herbivore to select foods), larger rumen/reticulum of grazers promotes longer retention of food, greater nutrient extraction via microbial fermentation

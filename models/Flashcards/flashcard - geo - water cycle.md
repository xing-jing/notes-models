drainage system definition
?
area of land drained by a river and its tributaries

water cycle definition
?
circulation of meteoric water through the hydrosphere, atmosphere and upper parts of crust

water cycle processes
?
input, store, transfer, output

list input process in water cycle (1)
?
precipitation

list stores in water cycle (4)
?
surface storage, interception, soil moisture, groundwater

list transfer processes in water cycle (5)
?
surface runoff/overland flow, infiltration, percolation, groundwater flow, throughflow

list output process in water cycle (1)
?
river discharge (eventually. evaporation)

interception definition
?
temporary storage of water on surface of plants/buildings before it reaches the surface

infiltration definition
?
movement of water into soil

throughflow definition
?
movement of water through soil

groundwater flow
?
movement of water through (nigh) impermeable rock (bedrock); rate is very slow

water cycle and ? combine to create the rock cycle

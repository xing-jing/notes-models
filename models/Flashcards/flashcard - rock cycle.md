rock cycle definition
?
processes undergone by the three main rock types as they form, move and transform

rock cycle system - components
?
igneous rock, sedimentary rock, metamorphic rock; magma, sediment; agents that change one rock type to another

processes within rock system that change the components (i.e. interaction within rock system between its components)
?
cooling magma -> crystallization -> igneous rock
sediment -> lithification (compaction, cementation, recrystallization) -> sedimentary rock
any rock type -> heat and pressure -> metamorphic rock
any rock type -> weathering, transport, deposition -> sediment
any rock type -> melting -> magma

weathering definition
?
decay of rocks by biological, chemical, and mechanical agents with little or no transport; a process that disintegrates and loosens rock

regolith definition
?
weathered rock (any degree of weathering)

saprolite definition
?
weathered rock in situ, retention of original rock structure but sufficiently broken down that it can be readily augured or dug through

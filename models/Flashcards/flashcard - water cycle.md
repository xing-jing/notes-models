processes in water cycle
?
input, transfer, store, output

list input in water cycle (1):
?
precipitation

list transfer processes in water cycle (5):
?
infiltration, surface runoff, groundwater flow, throughflow, percolation

list output in water cycle (1):
?
river discharge

list storage sinks in water cycle (3):
?
surface storage, interception (by vegetation), soil moisture

list direct transfers/storage from precipitation
?
surface storage, interception, surface runoff, infiltration

definition - infiltration
?
movement of water **into** soil

definition - throughflow
?
movement of water **through** soil

definition - groundwater flow
?
movement of water above impermeable rock (bedrock)

definition - interception
?
temporary storage of water on surface of plants/buildings before it reaches soil

water cycle and plate tectonics combine to create
?
rock cycle

#flashcards/mantle_convection

structure of rayleigh benard system (convective system) (label parts only)
?
upper and lower boundaries with temperature difference, fluid parcel between upper and lower boundaries

interaction within rayleigh benard system
?
1. buoyancy: upwards displacement of fluid parcel
2. viscosity and thermal conductivity: dampening of upwards displacement of fluid parcel

fundamental causes of interaction within rayleigh benard system
?
1. gravitational instability - from density difference from thermal expansion coefficient and temperature difference
2. convective instability - if buoyancy not mitigated by viscosity and temperature difference between fluid parcel and surrounding fluid not mitigated by thermal conduction

gravitational instability within convective system may lead to
?
convective instability, if insufficiently damped (e.g. by viscosity, thermal conduction)

surface expression of mantle convection is
?
plate tectonics

earth surface, viewed in terms of convective system is
?
top cold thermal boundary layer

mantle convection interaction with plate tectonics
?
convective currents deform and chemically modify top (and bottom) layer(s); hot upwelling mantle currents generate surface uplifts or induce volcanic activity; downwelling mantle currents pull surface down from below

earth's top cold thermal boundary layer is subdivided into
?
tectonic plates

structure of earth surface, viewed as top cold thermal boundary layer
?
1. subdivided into tectonic plates
2. plates have plate boundaries

types of plate boundaries
?
**convergent** boundaries - subduction zones, cold denser plates sink into mantle
**divergent** boundaries - midocean ridges, hot mantle material undergo partial melting and ascend to drive ridge volcanism and form new oceanic crust
**transform** boundaries - not directly associated with upward/downward convective currents, but due to non-linear rock rheology

rheology definition
?
response to stress through deformation (i.e. strain rate); **relationship** between **applied stress** and **resultant deformation**

types (2) of crustal deformations and their definitions
?
faults and folds. faults - break in rock formation + slip. folds - layers of rock deformed (plastic deformation)

convection, definition
?
buoyancy driven fluid flow

rayleigh number
?
number associated with convection, characterizing fluid's flow regime; describes behavior of fluids when mass density of fluid is non-uniform

earthquakes are characterized by
?
location, magnitude (amount of energy released), intensity (destructive effects of ground shaking)

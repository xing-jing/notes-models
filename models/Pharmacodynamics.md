Paracelsus: "the dose makes the poison"[^1]
- basis of dose-response relationship
- all substances are poisons, depending on the dose
	- pharmacology: interaction of chemicals or macromolecules with biological systems to yield therapeutic or other beneficial effect
	- toxicology: harmful effects that chemicals, substances, or situations can have on people, animals, and the environment 

> This finding also provides the basis for public health standards, which specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in food, public drinking water, and the environment.

>key takeaways - when something happens, it can be interpreted as **therapeutic (beneficial)** or **adverse**; alternatively, it can also be interpreted as **intended** or **unintended**; it can then be interpreted according to **severity** along either objective (intention, other)

**side effect** definition
- an effect, whether **therapeutic** or **adverse**, that is **secondary** to the **primary one** intended
- although the term is predominantly employed to describe **adverse effects**, it can also apply to **beneficial but unintended** consequences of the use of a drug
	- example: Sildenafil
		- synthesized by Pfizer, initially studied for use in hypertension and angina pectoris
		- Phase I trial suggested the drug had little effect on angina but could induce marked penile erection

**adverse event** definition
- any unfavorable and unintended symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure
- differing **severities**, called **grade**, from 1 (mild) to 5 (death)
	- mild... moderate... severe... life-threatening... death

every drug has a **therapeutic window**[^2]
- definition: dosage range between a **minimum effective therapeutic concentration**, and the **minimum toxic concentration**
- measured by: **therapeutic index**, a quantification of relative safety of drug[^3]
	- therapeutic index: TD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>
		- TD<sub>50</sub> = dose of drug that causes a toxic response in 50% of the population
		- ED<sub>50</sub> = dose of drug that is therapeutically effective in 50% of the population
	- safer drug has higher therapeutic index - large lethal dose, very small effective dose
	- more dangerous drug has lower therapeutic index, and may require regular monitoring of drug levels

> in other words:
> - large (or high) therapeutic index = large therapeutic window between effective concentration and toxic concentration of medication, so drug is relatively safe
> -  small (or low) therapeutic index = small therapeutic window between effective concentration and the toxic concentration


---
**duration** and **dosing**
- **duration** is correlated with **elimination**
- if a medication has a short **half-life** (i.e. **eliminated** quickly from body), the **therapeutic effect** is shorter; the medication may require repeated dosing throughout the day in order to achieve steady blood levels of active free drug and a sustained therapeutic effect

---
definitions[^4]
- efficacy: maximum effect that a drug can produce regardless of dose
- potency: amount of drug needed to produce a given effect
	- determined by **affinity** of drug for receptor and number of receptors available

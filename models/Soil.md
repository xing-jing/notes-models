general process view

Soil is the outcome of **material** and **material interaction**
- processes that make up material: addition, loss
- processes for material interaction (chemical) - leaching

addition
- organic matter accumulation
	- e.g.**leaf litter**, animals on surface, or in subsurface: plant roots, burrowing animals
	- decomposes by bacteria to humus
- inorganic matter accumulation
	- dust
	- regolith production
	- sediment deposition
loss
- erosion by wind or water

leaching
- movement and removal of dissolved matter in soil via water
- e.g. leaching from upper soil - **zone of leaching** - to deeper soil - **zone of accumulation** due to **water infiltration**

>[!comments]
>an ecologist would say "dissolved **nutrients**"; a geologist would say "dissolved **minerals**"

modifiers of material interaction (of soil formation process) (besides soil itself, covered in soil particle size)[^3]
- **climatic conditions** - **temperature** and **precipitation** - affect weathering and leaching
- **topography** - soils developed on higher elevations and slopes are excessively/well drained, and surface runoff is moderate/rapid
- other: parent material (deposit on which soils develop), time, organisms

form view

forms
- soil profile (outcome of processes)
- grain size (modifies process rates)

soil profile view

soil has **layers**, called **horizons**, that form a **soil profile**

![[Pasted image 20230913235211.png]]

soil profile[^2]
- O horizon - organic matter, humus; at least 20-30% organic material by mass
	- accumulated e.g. from **high production of leaf litter in forested areas**, **anaerobic conditions** slowing decomposition processes and allowing organic material to accumulate
- A horizon - mineral horizon, always formed at the surface, also called **topsoil**
	- over time, a **zone of loss**, so it's less clay (coarser) compared to underlying horizons
	- dominant processes are **additions** and **losses**
- B horizon - mineral subsurface horizon, a **zone of accumulation** with **chemical precipitation** (typically of **clays**)
	- in human modified landscapes, erosion can strip away overlying horizons and leave a B horizon at surface - in sloping or agricultural landscapes
- C horizon - regolith. physically/chemically weathered bedrock (parent material), either created *in situ* or transported into present location[^1]. no dominant processes, some low intensity ones (redox, minimal additions and losses) may occur
- E horizon - zone of eluviation - lots of leaching, could be due to perched water table

>[!comments]
>C horizon comprises weathered rocks, but termed "no dominant processes" likely due to duration of weathering compared to leaching, precipitation, erosion, decomposition/humification

grain properties view
- % porosity
	- definition: volume of pore space/volume of sediment \* 100
- permeability
	- definition: pore interconnectedness - distance/time
	- measures how easily water flows through

sizes: clay < silt < sand < gravel
implication of **grain size** on **drainage conditions**: the larger grain size, the higher soil permeability, better drainage (water infiltration) will be

soil's mechanical behavior

materials react differently to stress (have different **rheology** (response to stress))

![[Pasted image 20230913230738.png]]

> Soil materials can behave as solids, elastic solids, plastics, or even fluids, in accordance with how much water they contain. In soils, clay content, along with the air and water content of voids, determines the mechanical behaviour. The **shrinkage limit** defines the point below which soils preserve a constant volume upon drying and behave as a solid. The **plastic limit** is minimum moisture content at which the soil can be moulded. The **liquid limit** is the point at which, owing to high moisture content, the soil becomes a suspension of particles in water and will flow under its own weight.
> 
> The three limits separating different kinds of soil behaviour – **shrinkage limit, plastic limit**, and **fluid limit** – are known as **Atterberg limits**, after Albert Atterberg, the Swedish soil scientist who first investigated them.

![[Pasted image 20230913230754.png]]

quick clays (or sensitive soils)
- honeycomb structure that allows water content to go above the liquid limit
- if such soils are subject to high shear stresses, perhaps owing to an earthquake or to burial, they may suddenly collapse, squeezing out water and turning the soil into a fluid
- a violent shaking, as given by a **seismic shock**, may also liquefy a saturated mass of sand

quibbles about the definition of soil

definitions of soil
- geologists, engineers: soft, unconsolidated rock
	- implications
		- weathered rock, unconsolidated rock material above unaltered bedrock is soil material
		- no distinction between soil and **regolith**: weathered material lying above unaltered/fresh bedrock
			- regolith is inclusive of
				- saprolite: *in situ* weathered rock
				- residuum: disturbed weathered rock
				- **transported** surficial **sediments**
				- topsoil
				- etc. e.g. volcanic ash...
- pedologists: portion of regolith that supports plant life and where soil-forming processes dominate
	- problems with definition
		- some saline and laterite surfaces cannot support plants - is this soil?
		- lichen-encrusted bare rock surface - soil?

personal definition
- rock capable of supporting vegetative cover
- regolith + organic matter = soil

---
definitions
- alluvium: unconsolidated, stratified deposit laid down by running water, sometimes applied only to fine sediment (silt and clay) but more generally used to include sands and gravels as well
- clay: fine-grained sedimentary rock, plastic when wet, that consists of grains smaller than 0.002mm. can be made of clay minerals but also of calcite, iron pyrite, altered feldspars, muscovite flakes, iron oxides, organic material
	- formed through **chemical weathering of silicates**
	- typically aluminosilicates, precipitated out in the zone of accumulation (after leaching dissolves the ions, and they concentrate where water infiltration reaches its limits (less water))

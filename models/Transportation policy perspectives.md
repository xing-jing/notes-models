this note covers the three perspectives on transportation policy (their assumptions), and their causes (ease of particular assumptions and measurements), described by Litman 2003 in Measuring Transportation: Traffic, Mobility and Accessibility[^1]

> Transportation systems can be evaluated in various ways that reflect different perspectives concerning users, modes, land use, transport problems and solutions, how transport activity is measured, and the type of performance indicators used.

##### Traffic
- traffic implies **vehicular** traffic, vehicle movement
- assumptions:
	- primary way to improve transportation system quality is to **increase vehicle mileage and speed**
	- **transportation users** are primarily **motorists** (both drivers and passengers)
	- **single mode** - automobile travel is prioritized; little value placed on **transit**, **cycling**, and **walking** is considered primarily as a way for motorists to access parking facilities or as a form of recreation
- this perspective is been brought to you by
	- **ease of measurement** of **vehicular traffic**
		- performance indicators - traffic volumes, speeds, roadways level of service, congestion delay, parking supply, crash rates...

>This perspective defines transportation problems in terms of costs, barriers and risks to motorists. It favors solutions that increase road and parking capacity, roadway traffic speeds, vehicle ownership, and the affordability of driving. From this perspective, the best way to benefit non-drivers is to help them become motorists, by making automobile and taxi travel convenient and inexpensive.

##### Mobility
- mobility indicates **movement** of people or goods in general
- assumptions:
	- any increase in travel mileage or speed benefits society (not specifically vehicle mileage, but travel mileage)
	- **transportation users** are mainly motorists, but some people rely on non-automobile modes
	- multimodal - automobile is most important, but acknowledges **transit**, **ridesharing**, **cycling**... when there is **sufficient demand**. this also implies an **integrated view** of the transport system, with attention to **connections** between modes
- this perspective is been brought to you by
	- travel surveys to quantify person-miles, traffic data... this is relatively more difficult to measure than **vehicular traffic**

> A mobility perspective defines transportation problems in terms of constraints on physical movement, and so favors solutions that increase motor vehicle system capacity and speed, including road and parking facility improvements, transit and ridesharing improvements, high-speed train, aviation and intermodal connections. It gives little consideration to walking and cycling except where they provide access to motorized modes, since they represent a small portion of person-miles. From this perspective, the best way to benefit non-drivers is to improve motorized transport, including automobile, transit and taxi modes, with more modest consideration of walking and cycling.


##### Accessibility
- access is the **ability** to reach **opportunities**: desired goods, services, activities, destinations
	- the ultimate goal of most transportation
	- except where movement is an end in itself: jogging, horseback riding, pleasure drives with no destination
- assumptions:
	- the way to improving transportation is not just **improved mobility** but also **improved land use accessibility** (reducing distance between destinations) and **improved mobility substitutes** e.g. **telecommunications** and **delivery services**
	- **transportation users** - most people use various access options, cannot be classified as simply motorist or transit rider
	- **multi-modal** - values modes according to ability to meet users' needs, and does not necessarily favour longer trips or faster modes if shorter trips and slower modes provide adequate access
		- from this perspective, **land use** is as important as **mobility** in the quality of transportation
- this perspective is brought to you by
	- not really brought to you - access is relatively difficult to measure because it can be affected by so many factors e.g. access to employment affected by location of suitable jobs, feasibility of telework, quality and cost of travel options that reach work-site...
	- performance indicators can be:
		- time and money required to reach desired services and activities
		- total travel costs

> Accessibility-based planning expands the range of transport problems and potential solutions that can be considered. From this perspective, transport problems include any cost, barrier or risk that prevents people from reaching desired opportunities. Solutions can include traffic improvements, mobility improvements, mobility substitutes, (such as telecommuting and delivery services), and more accessible land use.

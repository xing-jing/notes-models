climatic swings between **glacials** and **interglacials**

tensional, compressive, shear stresses -> normal, reverse, transform fault. stress from movement of tectonic plates, fault at divergent/convergent/transform plate boundaries. faults have no length scales. fault is a break in a rock formation (fracture) + a slip along it.

earthquake
- when stress overcomes **friction**, movement of slip along faults produces **seismic waves** that propagates through **earth's layers**
- rupture, elastic rebound, aftershocks
- earthquake characterization: location, magnitude (amount of energy released), intensity (destructive effects of ground shaking)

forces that act on geomorphic materials:
- gravitational forces
- fluid forces
- water pressure forces
- expansion forces
- global fluid movements
- biological forces

fluid forces: water flowing downhill under influence of its own weight. moving water uses only part of downslope force, and portion left over may carry material in flow or along water-ground contact. water carries dissolved material that travels as the same velocity as water.)

expansion forces: heating and cooling cycles, freezing and thawing cycles, wetting and drying cycles

global fluid movements: wind carries sediment in much the same way as water does - along the 'bed' or in suspension. but, as air is far less dense a fluid than water, for the same flow velocity it carries sediment of smaller grain size.

deposition is the laying down of sediment by chemical, physical or biological means.

deposition
- when the transporting capacity of the fluid is insufficient to carry the solid sediment load, or where the chemical environment leads to the precipitation of the solute load, deposition of sediment occurs. sedimentary bodies occur where deposition outpaces erosion, and where chemical precipitation exceeds solutional loss.

main categories of constituents of soil?
?
organic matter e.g. leaf litter added or lost via e.g. erosion, inorganic matter e.g. regolith, saprolite, transported and deposited sediments

definition of regolith
?
weathered material lying above unaltered/fresh bedrock

definition of saprolite
?
*in situ* weathered rock

my definition of soil
?
regolith + organic matter

leaching definition
?
movement and removal of dissolved nutrients/minerals in soil via water

non-soil factors affecting soil formation process
?
climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation), topography (elevation, slope, runoff, drainage), parent material, time, organisms

soil profile definition
?
layers (also called horizons) of soil

the soil profile layers are:
?
O, A, B, C, E

O horizon characteristics, processes
?
at least 20-30% organic matter by mass. accumulation of organic material can be from high production of **leaf litter** in forested areas, or **anaerobic conditions** slowing decomposition

A horizon characteristics, processes
?
mineral horizon, always formed at surface, called **topsoil**, a zone of loss hence less clay and coarser. processes: additions and losses

B horizon characteristics, processes
?
mineral subsurface horizon, zone of accumulation with chemical precipitation of clays (from dissolved silicates)

C horizon characteristics, processes
?
regolith, no dominant processes (minimal processes e.g. redox)

E horizon
?
zone of eluviation - lots of leaching - could be due to perched water table

what does grain size affect, and how
?
grain size affects drainage conditions. larger grain size, higher permeability, better drainage (water infiltration)

% porosity definition
?
volume of pore space/volume of sediment \* 100

permeability definition
?
pore interconnectedness, measured by distance of water infiltration/time

what are the atterberg limits, and definitions for limits
?
limits separating different kinds of soil behavior. shrinkage limit, plastic limits, liquid limits. shrinkage limit: point below which soils preserve constant volume upon drying and behave as solid. plastic limit: minimum moisture content at which soil can be moulded (act as plastic). liquid limit: point at which soil becomes a suspension of particles in water and will flow under its own weight.

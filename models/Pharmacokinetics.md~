##### Phases of pharmacokinetics
1. absorption (from site of administration to bloodstream)
2. distribution (once in bloodstream, how it moves in out through tissue)
3. metabolism (how drug is chemically altered - activated, inactivated)
4. elimination (how drug moves out the body)

four phases map to pharmacokinetic parameters: bioavailability, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance[^2]
###### Absorption
- transport (cellular biology view - assume capillary bed, one cell layer thick)
	- passive - fat soluble drug (through phospholipid bilayer), or small, water soluble drug (through aquaporins)
	- facilitated - slightly bigger water soluble drug
	- active - bigger water soluble drug
	- bulk (endocytosis) - big drug molecule; membrane has to absorb it
- routes
	- gastrointestinal tract
	- skin (which is waterproof, so not suitable for water soluble drugs)
	- subcutaneously (lots of fat)
	- intramuscular (lots of water, suitable for water soluble drugs)
	- IV (complete bioavailability)
- primary measure: **bioavailability** (fraction of drug absorbed into systemic circulation from site of administration)

###### Distribution
- how well drug moves from blood into tissue; how widely drug moves to different compartments in tissue
	- factors
		- blood flow - brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys - increases speed of distribution
		- properties of drug - fat soluble drugs move through membranes more easily
		- interaction with blood proteins - blood has albumin; albumin is a good carrier for some drugs; warfarin locks onto plasma protein, and acts as blood thinner
- primary measure: apparent **volume of distribution** (concentration of dose/concentration in plasma)

###### Metabolism
- the way a drug is chemically turned on or off
- liver is the primary organ, metabolizes (first pass effect - reduction in bioavailability (absorption)) in 2 phases
	- phase 1 - cytochrome p450 (enzyme) that makes drug less lipid soluble, more water soluble so when it goes to elimination (kidneys) it's easier to get rid of
	- phase 2 - conjugation - water soluble group added to drug
	- factors
		- age (infants have immature livers)
- primary measure: **half-life**

###### Elimination
- excretion: getting rid of drug while it's still active
- elimination: chemically turning drug inactive
- primary measure: **clearance rates**

> Injecting a vaccine into the layer of subcutaneous fat, where poor vascularity may result in slow mobilisation and processing of antigen, is a cause of vaccine failure1—for example in hepatitis B,2 rabies, and influenza vaccines.3

examples 1: caffeine metabolism[^1]

1. **absorption**
- rapidly and completely absorbed
- when consumed in beverages (e.g. coffee, tea, soft drinks), coffee is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout body water
2. **metabolism**
- appears to be no hepatic first-pass effect - liver does not appear to remove caffeine as it passes from gut to systemic circulation
3. **distribution**
- caffeine binds reversibly to plasma proteins
- hydrophilic enough to distribute freely into intracellular tissue water
- lipophilic enough to pass through all biological membranes - readily crosses blood brain barrier
4. **elimination**
- first-order kinetics

physiological effects
- cognitive performance
	- inhibition of adenosine receptors through competitive binding -> central nervous system stimulation
		- there are two main classes of adenosine receptors, A1 and A2 - caffeine and paraxanthine are nonselective antagonists at both
- cardiostimulatory
	- inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzymes in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues -> prevention of decomposition of cyclic AMP to AMP -> sustains cardiac muscle contraction (as cAMP sustains cardiac muscle contraction)

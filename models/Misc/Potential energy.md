>an object (with mass) moving with no outside influences (i.e. no potential energy) is subject to inertia in classical physics, or equivalently in the classical path-based (Lagrangian) formulation, the minimization of action, i.e. minimization of v<sup>2</sup>, the object moves in a straight line.

>an outside influence can cause the object's path to change. this outside influence is equivalent to potential energy.

definitions of Lagrangian and action[^1]
- Lagrangian is defined by subtracting potential energy from kinetic energy (KE - PE)
- action is defined by adding up the Lagrangian at every instant along a path (S = \\int KE-PE dt)

>this implies fixed positions and times at the start and end: particle starts at position x_i, t_i, ends at position x_f, t_f

alternative term: gastrointestinal tract

digestive system
- definition: system that takes in food, breaks down food into micronutrients, absorbs these nutrients into the bloodstream to be dispersed into tissues in body to be used as energy or building blocks, and whatever remains is defecated and leaves the body 

structure:
- alimentary canal
	- definition: hollow muscular tube starting at mouth and ending at anus
- accessory digestive structures
	- definition: organs typically with duct/tube leading into alimentary canal

structure of alimentary canal
- mouth
- pharynx
- esophagus
- stomach
- small intestine
- large intestine
- anus

list of accessory digestive structures
- tongue, teeth, salivary glands
- pancreas, liver, gallbladder

functions:
- intake - of food
- secretion - of enzymes and mucus (to combat friction)
- mixing and propulsion - the **process** of peristalsis (contraction, relaxation of smooth muscle)
- digestion - mechanical, via peristalsis; chemical, via secreted enzymes
- absorption - at different sites (alcohol @ stomach, nutrients @ small intestine, water and electrolytes @ large intestine)
- defecation - also called excretion

>[!comments]
>digestion within the digestive system, compared to soil infiltration, or lithification
>commonalities - something passing through a system
>differences - my first encounter with "state". rocks through rock cycle don't retain other matter/energy, but are simply transformed (atoms are rearranged - possible for there to be no extra atoms). water infiltrating soil can carry minerals down, but it's a simple, linear process: mostly removal of minerals/nutrients from upper layers to bottom layers. minerals/nutrients are quite unreactive. notably, the pancreas secretes alkaline bicarbonate to counteract stomach acid at the duodenum (first section of small intestine) i.e. state is created and intentionally reversed. parts of process are broken up as well: secretion of enzymes and digestion happen in multiple parts.

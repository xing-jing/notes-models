alternative term: gastrointestinal tract

digestive system
- definition: system that takes in food, breaks down food into micronutrients, absorbs these nutrients into the bloodstream to be dispersed into tissues in body to be used as energy or building blocks, and whatever remains is defecated and leaves the body 

structure
- alimentary canal
	- definition: hollow muscular tube starting at mouth and ending at anus
- accessory digestive structures
	- definition: organs typically with duct/tube leading into alimentary canal

structure of alimentary canal
- mouth
- pharynx
- esophagus
- stomach
- small intestine
- large intestine
- anus

accessory digestive structures
- in **oral cavity**: tongue, teeth, salivary glands
- pancreas, liver, gallbladder

functions:
- intake - of food
- secretion - of enzymes and mucus (to combat friction)
- mixing and propulsion - the **process** of peristalsis (contraction, relaxation of smooth muscle - of alimentary canal)
- digestion - mechanical, via peristalsis; chemical, via secreted enzymes
- absorption - at different sites (alcohol @ stomach, nutrients @ small intestine, water and electrolytes @ large intestine)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- excretion of indigestible products - also called defecation

>[!comment]
>compare to pharmacokinetics (way drug moves through body) - absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination; bioavailability (fraction of drug absorbed into systemic circulation from site of administration)

structure and function
- mucosa
	- epithelia (lines the inside, protects one environment from next environment)
	- lamina profria - loose connective tissue
	- muscularis mucosa
- submucosa
	- loose connective tissue
	- nerve plexus
- muscularis externa
	- 2 muscle layers - circular smooth muscle, longitudinal muscle (shortens when contracting)
- serosa (also called adventitia)
	- reduces friction between organs and rest of body

sphincter - thickened circular smooth muscle
peristalsis - longitudinal muscle

esophagus
- first third: skeletal muscle only (voluntary)
- second third: skeletal and smooth muscle
- bottom third: smooth muscle only (involuntary)

stomach
- three, not two muscle layers for mechanical digestion

- inside of GIT is continuous with outside of body
- i.e. epithelia (layers of cells) lines GIT on both inside and outside

with epithelia, form dictates function
stratified squamous - protection
simple squamous - single layer - gaseous exchange
- columnar (shape of cells) - long cells with big intracellular compartments - for secreting and absorbing substances

esophagus is just for movement. protection - stratified squamous
stomach - first site of mechanical and chemical digestion. columnar epithelial. mucous secreting neck cells, parietal cells, g cells. single layer of columnar epithelia. gastric pits containing cells secreting enzymes and chemical. no goblet.
small and large intestines - also simple columnar. large intracellular components (ER, golgi, ribozomes) - absorb and secrete. projections of GIT in small intestines to increase surface area. only small intestines have villi and microvilli. villi extensions of lamina propria. microvilli are extensions of epithelia. no villi in large intestines, but there are microvilli. 
rectum - from proximal to distal (from inside to outside) - simple columnar, simple cuboidal, stratified squamous, stratified squamous keratinised. keratin is a protein that makes cells waterproof.

swallowing
- opening (lateral pterygoid) and closing jaw (three muscles; masseter, temporalis, medial pterygoid)
- what nerve innervates these muscles - cranial nerve 5, coming out of brain stem
- buccinator muscles (of cheeks), orbicularis oris of lips need to close off. caused by facial nerve (cranial nerve 7). tightens cheeks and lips.
- tongue moving food - nerve that innervates is the hypoglossal nerve, cranial nerve 12 - to deliver food to teeth to chew it up. tongue manipulating the food
- taste comes from facial nerve
- moistening the food - salivary glands releasing saliva.
- at this stage, moistened bit of food that is broken up is called bolus
- tongue contracts, lifting trachea, closing off larynx (airway) airway, at the same time stretching  open esophagus
- medulla (swallowing center), via vagus nerve (cranial nerve 10) tells muscles of soft palate to contract, closing off nasal cavity (nasal pharynx)
- turned combined compartment of air and food to just compartment of food. 

proteins -> protease -> amino acids
fats -> lipase -> glycerol, fatty acids
carbs -> amylase -> glucose

physiological processes involved in digestion, absorption and excretion of major nutrients and vitamins

can only absorb in micronutrients formed.
fats - forming membranes, general structure of body. proteins play functional roles in body.

mouth - first site of chemical digestion for carbohydrates
esophagus -> simply conduit, no digestion
stomach -> release of protease. enzyme is called pepsin. stomach is first site of protein digestion. pepsin is released as pepsinogen by chief cells, -ogen means inactive form. parietal cells release hydrochloric acid, which activates pepsinogen into pepsin. 
small intestine is first site of fat digestion
=======
- defecation - also called excretion

>[!comments]
>digestion within the digestive system, compared to soil infiltration, or lithification
>commonalities - something passing through a system
>differences - my first encounter with "state". rocks through rock cycle don't retain other matter/energy, but are simply transformed (atoms are rearranged - possible for there to be no extra atoms). water infiltrating soil can carry minerals down, but it's a simple, linear process: mostly removal of minerals/nutrients from upper layers to bottom layers. minerals/nutrients are quite unreactive. notably, the pancreas secretes alkaline bicarbonate to counteract stomach acid at the duodenum (first section of small intestine) i.e. state is created and intentionally reversed. parts of process are broken up as well: secretion of enzymes and digestion happen in multiple parts.

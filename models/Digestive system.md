alternative term: gastrointestinal tract

this note covers
- definition
- form view, process view of system
	- form - structure, and sub-structure (in terms of muscles, cell types)
	- process - functions, and specific functions of sub-structures
- since "process" is from the perspective of the internals of the systems, think about the external view of the system - in terms of its functions/states i.e. digestive system performance for different physiologies (animals, aging)

digestive system
- definition: system that takes in food, breaks down food into micronutrients, absorbs these nutrients into the bloodstream to be dispersed into tissues in body to be used as energy or building blocks, and whatever remains is defecated and leaves the body 

---

proteins -> protease -> amino acids
fats -> lipase -> glycerol, fatty acids
carbs -> amylase -> glucose

###### functions
1. **intake** - of food
2. **secretion** - of enzymes and mucus (to combat friction)
3. **mixing** and **propulsion** - the **process** of peristalsis (contraction, relaxation of smooth muscle - of alimentary canal)
4. **digestion** - mechanical, via peristalsis; chemical, via secreted enzymes
5. **absorption** - at different sites (alcohol @ stomach, nutrients @ small intestine, water and electrolytes @ large intestine)
6. **excretion** of **indigestible** products - also called defecation

>[!comment]
>compare to pharmacokinetics (way drug moves through body) - absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination; bioavailability (fraction of drug absorbed into systemic circulation from site of administration)

###### structure
- alimentary canal
	- definition: hollow muscular tube starting at mouth and ending at anus - most of it, save the stomach, is two layered for peristalsis - circular smooth muscle, longitudinal muscle (shortens when contracting)
	- structure
		- mouth
			- uses many muscles to open/close jaw, tighten cheeks and lips, manipulate food (tongue) - deliver to teeth to chew; tongue contraction lifts trachea, closing off larynx (airway) airway, at the same time stretching open esophagus; muscles of soft palate to contract, closing off nasal cavity (nasal pharynx)
			- various cranial nerves coming out of brain stem enervate those muscles
		- pharynx
		- esophagus
			- muscle
				- first third: skeletal muscle only (voluntary)
				- second third: skeletal and smooth muscle
				- bottom third: smooth muscle only (involuntary)
			- cell
				- stratified squamous - for protection
		- stomach
			- the first site of mechanical and chemical digestion for protein
			- muscle
				- **three** layers of muscle - extra layer for churning and mechanical digestion!
			- cell
				- columnar - for secretion and absorption
		- small intestine
			- villi **and** microvilli (stomach only has villi)
			- simple columnar
		- large intestine
			- villi **and** microvilli (stomach only has villi)
			- simple columnar
		- anus
			- muscle
				- like sphincter at esophagus, has thickened circular smooth muscle
			- cell
				- from proximal to distal (from inside to outside) - simple columnar, simple cuboidal, stratified squamous, stratified squamous keratinised
					- keratin is a protein that makes cells waterproof.
- accessory digestive structures
	- definition: organs typically with duct/tube leading into alimentary canal
	- in **oral cavity**: tongue, teeth, salivary glands
	- pancreas, liver, gallbladder

>[!comments]
>squamous cells - make up most of the cells in the epidermis (outer layer of the skin)
>inside of gastrointestinal tract is continuous with outside of body; epithelia (layers of cells) lines gastrointestinal tract on both inside and outside; with epithelia, form dictates function
>- stratified squamous: protection
>- simple squamous: single layer - gas exchange
>- columnar: long cells with big intracellular compartments (ER, golgi) - for secretion and absorption

###### structure of layers, inside to out
- mucosa
	- epithelia (lines the inside, protects one environment from next environment)
	- lamina propria - loose connective tissue
	- muscularis mucosa
- submucosa
	- loose connective tissue
	- nerve plexus
- muscularis externa
	- 2 muscle layers - circular smooth muscles, longitudinal muscle
- serosa (also called adventitia)
	- reduces friction between organs and rest of body

###### process view, function
- mouth: first site of chemical digestion for carbohydrates
- esophagus: simply a conduit, no digestion
- stomach: first site of protein digestion
	- **secretion**
		1. release of **protease**, specifically the enzyme called **pepsin**, released as **pepsinogen** by chief cells (-ogen means inactive form)
		2. parietal cells release hydrochloric acid, which activates pepsinogen into pepsin
- small intestine: first site of fat digestion
- large intestine: formation, elimination of feces (defection, also called excretion)

>[!comments]
>digestion within the digestive system, compared to soil infiltration, or lithification
>commonalities - something passing through a system
>differences - my first encounter with "state". rocks through rock cycle don't retain other matter/energy, but are simply transformed (atoms are rearranged - possible for there to be no extra atoms). water infiltrating soil can carry minerals down, but it's a simple, linear process: mostly removal of minerals/nutrients from upper layers to bottom layers. minerals/nutrients are quite unreactive. notably, the pancreas secretes alkaline bicarbonate to counteract stomach acid at the duodenum (first section of small intestine) i.e. state is created and intentionally reversed. parts of process are broken up as well: secretion of enzymes and digestion happen in multiple parts.

###### different "states" of the digestive system - digestive system behavior?
- in infants
- in elderly
- in animals

**in infants**
> Newborns need the structural and functional maturation of the GI tract for digestion and absorption of the nutrients from colostrum and breast milk. They also need a complete development of intestinal motor function which includes suck–swallow coordination, continence of the gastroesophageal sphincter tone, adequate gastric emptying, and intestinal peristalsis. Full-term babies can acquire adequate amounts of nutrients to promote the rapid growth that occurs shortly after birth. However, half of preterm infants are delayed in reaching full enteral feeding volumes and have gastroesophageal reflux, gastric residuals, and constipation due to delayed gastric emptying, prolonged bowel transit, abdominal distension, and delayed passage of meconium, all of which are GI functions describing immaturity. There are few studies available on fetal ontogenesis and early neonatal adaptation of motility and barrier functions of the human intestinal mucosa. The functional components of the human GI tract do not develop simultaneously: in fact, although the anatomical differentiation of the human intestine usually occurs within 20 GW, functional maturation is postponed over time and requires organized peristalsis and coordinated sucking and swallowing, which are not defined until 29–30 and 32–34 GW, respectively.

>Salivary amylase, which digests complex carbohydrates of 18–29 glucose units, is an initiator of carbohydrate digestion. Pancreatic amylase, the secretion of which is limited, not reaching adult levels until about 2 years of age, is responsible for most initial carbohydrate hydrolysis. Due to suck–swallow incoordination, enteral feeding in many preterm infants necessitates the use of feeding tubes. These bypass the oral cavity, hence also bypassing the activity of salivary amylase.
>
>Undigested carbohydrates pass into the distal intestine. Here, microbial fermentation results in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which subsequently are absorbed. These can be utilized as energy sources, but butyrate has been also shown to serve as an important fuel for colonocytes as well as having properties that alter proliferation, differentiation, and turnover of colonic cells.[^1]

**in elderly**[^2]
- food **intake** diminishes
- mouth changes
	- cause
		- age-related shrinkage of the maxillary (upper jaw) and mandibular (lower jaw) bones and reduction in bone calcium content cause a slow erosion of the tooth sockets, leading to gum recession and an increased risk of root decay; people without teeth or who have poorly fitting dentures may find chewing difficult
	- result
		- eat less and become malnourished OR they may choose highly refined, easy-to-chew foods, thereby consuming less dietary fibre; this will affect their bowel function, and may cause problems such as constipation
- swallowing
	- with age, the muscular contractions that initiate swallowing slow down, increasing pharyngeal transit time -> increased risk of choking
- stomach
	- reduction in ghrelin levels -> reduced appetite
- small and large intestine
	- small intestinal transit time does not seem to be affected
	- colonic transit time increases ->  delay in colonic transit of waste, leading to constipation

> The rate of cell division declines in the digestive epithelium, which cannot repair and replace itself as well as it needs to. There is also a drastic age-associated rise in the incidence of several gut pathologies including cancer of the colon – in fact, age is the key risk factor for colorectal cancer. Recent studies indicate that ageing induces changes in the DNA of epithelial intestinal cells, particularly in the colon; this process – known as DNA methylation – is believed to play a significant part in the development of colorectal cancers (Masoro and Austad, 2010).

**in grazers and browsers**
definitions
foraging: searching for wild food resources
grass: monocots
browses: herbaceous and woody dicots
- actually, anything that is consumed in **browsing**, a type of herbivory in which a herbivore feeds on leaves, shoots, fruits of shrubs etc.

grass
- **relatively homogenous food source**
	- leaves, stem, sheath, fruit differ in quality/form over only a very fine-scale that cannot be differentiated easily by large mammalian herbivores while foraging
- **continuous 3-dimensional layer of vegetation with constant density**
	- low growth form - new tillers added at base of plant
	- grasses grow in continuous dispersion - next nearest plant is likely a grass

browses
- **more heterogeneous assembly of plant parts of various nutritional qualities**
	- nutritious buds, mature leaves, woody stems
- **branching geometry** is **diffuse** and **irregular**
	- new plant tissues added at tip of browses
	- many browse species have spines, prickles, curved thorns
- tend to be **discrete in dispersion**
	- next nearest neighbor is less likely to be a browse

molar structure -> chewing rates, longevity of teeth
- high crowns allow for longer wear
differences in dispersion of grasses and browses -> different methods of searching and scales of food selection
- grazers choose diets based on characteristics of patch, pasture, or landscape (because grasses have a more continuous dispersion, are homogeneous except at very fine and large scales)
- browsers choose bites carefully, selecting leaves over stem, selecting shrub with larger leaves or thickest twigs
body size (mass) -> rate of microbial fermentation, mass of digestive tract contents, liquid passage rates, extent of fiber digestion
- larger rumen/reticulum of large animals promotes longer retention of food and thus greater nutrient extraction via microbial fermentation
- small animals need to obtain less food per day but require more energy per unit weight to fuel a higher mass-specific metabolism, thus must obtain a high rate of energy return per gram of food ingested
mouth structure
- grazers have wide muzzles, greater incisor width maximizing bite size while reducing ability of herbivore to select foods (smaller, more nutritious portion of grasses)
- browsers have larger mouth opening to permit sideways stripping

Road names are overseen by the Street and Building Names Board (SBNB), which was established in 2003 under the Property Tax Act. Property addresses are assigned by IRA based on approved street and building names.

objective of naming streets and buildings:
- to locate properties and essential services efficiently (in fact, or just in abstract)
- to promote/protect (cultural) heritage and (natural) history

> "The street name should be appropriate... to provide **directional cues**, **facilitate way finding** and allow **easy identification** of locations..."
> "Street names that acknowledge the history of the area are encouraged. This helps promote or reinforce a greater sense of history and identity among the community."
> "... the street name can reflect the presence of nearby physical landscape such as sea, river, or hill."
> "Names should be kept reasonably short and easy to pronounce, spell and remember... The proposed name should not duplicate or be too similar to existing street names in terms of pronunciation and spelling."

>in short, it is names must be 1. meaningful, so it can contextualize physical reality in cultural and natural history 2. informative - either about the type of road (LTA's road category) or their relation to each other (since an access road branches off an arterial one, for example)

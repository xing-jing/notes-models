###### Usability
- **quality attribute** that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use

###### Dimensions of usability
- learnability, efficiency, memorability, error tolerance and prevention, satisfaction
	- learnability: ease of learning and relearning

###### Effectiveness
- accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals[^1]

###### Efficiency
- resources used in relation to results achieved e.g. time, human effort, cost, materials[^1]

###### Goal
- intended outcome

###### User interface
- NIST definition[^2] : the physical or logical means by which users interact with a system, device or process
- textbook definition[^3] : the set of inputs and outputs that the user interacts with to invoke functions of an application

###### Affordances
- NIST: properties of a device/system that allow a user to perform action[^5]
- origin of term[^6]
	- rooted in **perceptual psychology**
	- defined as **action possibility** formed by **relationship** between an **agent** and its **environment**
	- "potential for action"

###### User experience
- ISO definition[^4] : user’s perceptions and responses that result from the use and/or anticipated use of a system, product or service
- implication:
	- emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical/psychological responses from users are all UX and can occur before, during, and after use


Usability vs. UX (user experience)
- traditional usability framework focused primarily on 1. user cognition 2. user performance
	- user's ability to **understand** and to **use** an "artifact" in HCI
- most researchers argue that UX emerged as an **extension** of usability to accommodate the fuzzy quality attributes of experience such s enjoyment, pleasure or fun 

UX methods categories[^7]
- **research** - understanding what the users need and their goals and behaviour
- **design** - creating and designing the interface or experience the user expects or needs
- **evaluation** - once interface/product is in a working state, users can test and evaluate if the interface/product maps to user's mental model and needs

examples of UX for physical interfaces

key issue: differentiation of inputs and differentiation of outputs
###### Differentiation of inputs
- why: error-proof interfaces
- types of coding
	- shape
	- colour
	- size
	- texture
	- position
	- operation
		- twist vs vertical slide

one-level above differentiation of inputs - **group-level** differentiation of inputs i.e. **interface organization**
###### Interface organization
- types
	- feature
	- operation
	- technology
	- user case
- organising by feature
	 - default design philosophy
- organising by operation
	- all valves together even though they control disparate parts of the system
- organising by technology
	- touchscreen with buttons by the side
- organising by use case
	- clustering based on daily routines and tasks of the user - not by system parts
